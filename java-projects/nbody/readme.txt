 During the course of the assignment I did initially run into some problems
 trying to output final data for the objects in the input files, until I 
 made sure the program and associated files of the assignment were in the 
 proper directories. At one point I also had encountered issues with "NaN"
 showing up for the values dealing with positions and velocities of objects
 and the images subsequently being printed on top of each other on one of 
 the corners of the window. That turned out to be due to the fact that I 
 did not set a conditional correctly in the loop, after which it was fine.
