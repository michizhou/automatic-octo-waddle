Programming Assignment 5: Linear Feedback Shift Register

Hours to complete assignment (optional): 8 hours

/**********************************************************************
 *  What is one advantage of making two separate classes for LFSR
 *  and PhotoMagic rather than putting everything in a single class?
 **********************************************************************/

 The presence of using two separate classes for LFSR and PhotoMagic allows
 for better program style and design for PhotoMagic, the client for LFSR 
 since the program itself can refer to functions located in the LFSR 
 class when it needs to call upon the function directly. This way, the 
 client PhotoMagic does not have to include the function definitions in
 the program body as well as their instance variables, streamlining the
 design aspects of the two classes by dividing methods.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you fill out the mid-semester feedback form?
 *  If not, do so now: https://goo.gl/forms/2PhiMknIdYRczeyG3
 **********************************************************************/

 Yes, I already did fill out the mid-semester feedback form.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you receive help from classmates, past COS 126 students, or
 *  anyone else?  Please list their names.  ("A Sunday lab TA" or 
 *  "Office hours on Thursday" is ok if you don't know their name.)
 **********************************************************************/

  For this assignment I did not receive any help from classmates or past
  COS 126 students, mostly doing the assignment on my own time and with
  my own efforts at trying to design the program and its implementation.


/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/

  There were no serious problems that were encountered in the course
  of working on this week's assignment.


/**********************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here.
